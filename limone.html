    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken limone is a luscious way to prepare chicken cutlets. The lemon pan
      sauce, with shallots for a sweet onion note, and just a touch of cream,
      really boosts the flavors of the browned bits that remain in the pan. It’s
      well-balanced, with great lemon flavor but no sour notes. Like chicken
      piccata without the salty capers, it’s a great quick dish for a weeknight
      dinner with friends.
