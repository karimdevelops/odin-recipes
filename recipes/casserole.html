    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This French onion chicken casserole is creamy, rich, and aromatic. It has
      all the components of French onion soup—plus chicken—even a crisp crouton
      topping.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups chopped yellow onion</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped celery</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped carrot</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh garlic</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, plus more for garnish</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for garnish</li>
      <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed French onion soup</li>
      <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>2 cups Gruyere cheese, shredded, divided</li>
      <li>
        6 cups chopped rotisserie chicken (from 1 1/2 whole rotisserie chickens)
      </li>
      <li>1 (5 ounce) package seasoned croutons</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>
          Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
          C).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>
          Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, celery,
          carrot, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper; cook, stirring often, until
          onions are softened and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>
          Add French onion soup, and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer,
          undisturbed, until reduced and slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.
          Stir in sour cream, mayonnaise, and mustard, and return to a simmer.
          Add 1 cup Gruyère, and cook, stirring constantly, until completely
          melted and combined, about 1 minute. Remove from heat, and fold in
          chicken.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>
          Transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Sprinkle croutons evenly over
          chicken mixture; sprinkle evenly with remaining Gruyère cheese. Bake
          in the preheated oven until bubbling and cheese is melted, 12 to 15
          minutes. Let rest 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with additional
          thyme and pepper.
